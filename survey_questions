The dataset is about house price of different number of bedrooms (1 bedroom housing to 5 bedroom housing) from years 2007 to 2012.

You are given two set of charts
1. The first set of chart are made of 6 donut charts, corresponding to each of the years
2. The second chart is the timeseries donut chart

Question 1:
Was there any 1 bedroom housing sold in year 2008? 
Was there any 2 bedroom housing sold in year 2007?


Question 2:
How many 2bd room houses are sold in each year? 

Question 3:
What are the types of houses sold in 2008

Question 4:
Which type of housing is the most expensive in the year 2007?
what about year 2009 and 2012?

Question 5:
Which type of housing sold the most (count) in the year 2007?
what about year 2010?

Question 6:
Without computing the exact value of sells (# of house sold * average price), Which type of housing sold the most (count * price) in the year 2009? generate the most revenue

Question 7:
In year 2011, list out all the percentages for each type of housing

Question 8:
Which type of house has the most expensive total sells (# of hosue sold * average price) over all years, what about the least expensive?

Question 9:
Find the total price sold of second most expensive total sells

Question 10:
Changes over the year for one cat

Question 11:
in which years do no 1bd house sold

# of unit sold
revenue generated

Trial Questions for Timeseries:

changing years
reading values
align baseline,
number of units vs revenue,
reinforce the meaning of area = total revenue, and average sell price = height of wedge

1. You are on the 2007's plot. Click on the wedge to go to the 2010's plot. Answer the following questions

Which type of bedroom is not being sold in 2010 (1 bedroom)

Which type of bedroom sold the most units in 2010 (percentage: 3 bedrooms)

What is the number of units sold of 2 bedrooms in 2010 (hover # of unit: 1)

Which type of bedroom generated the most revenue in 2010 (area: 4 bedrooms)

Which type of bedroom had the most expensive average price in 2010 (hover average price: 5 bedrooms)

2. Click any 2012's wedge. Answer the following questions

Which type of bedroom is not being sold in 2012 (2 bedrooms)

What is the total revenue generated by 3 bedrooms?

What is the total units sold for 4 bedrooms?

Which type of bedroom has the second most average price (compare the height of the wedge)?

3. What is the meaning of height of each wedge?

area is propotional to height * percentage

percentage is proportional to the number of units sold of that year

area is propotional to revenue

height related to the average price?
